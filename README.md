# Brent-WTI-Spread-Arbitrage-Calculator
This project explores crude oil arbitrage opportunities between U.S. WTI (Cushing) and North Sea Brent.

The analysis is based on the simple but fundamental principle of physical crude trading: if the price spread between Brent and WTI is greater than the cost of shipping a barrel across the Atlantic, then it is theoretically profitable to export U.S. crude to Europe and sell it against Brent.
